# Neural Networks
Senior Capstone project on Neural Networks. A Neural Network (NN) is a machine learning algorithm based on the biological neural networks of a brain. This algorithm can perform basic Machine Learning methods, such as Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM). In this project, I studied the fundamentals of Neural Networks for classification problems. The purpose of this approach is to develop an understanding of Neural Networks as well as the basic concepts of Machine Learning.

I applied these algorithms to supervised learning classification problems for MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. I compared the Linear Regression NN and SVM-NN with the classical Linear Regression and SVM algorithms.

## Dependencies
* Jupyter Notebook
* Anaconda
* Keras (Tensorflow backend)
Note: I need to polish this notebook and add more analysis.
